#+TITLE: Setup programming
#+DESCRIPTION: Setup prog-mode, which is the major mode all programming major modes extend from, and other stuff that has to do with programming
#+AUTHOR: Maximilian Kuschewski
#+PROPERTY: my-file-type emacs-config-package

* :use-package rainbow-delimiters
** :defer t
** :init
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
#+end_src
*** :use-package rainbow-identifiers
* Autocomplete
Don't to autocomplete for now - it slows down writing quite a bit
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'auto-complete-mode)
#+end_src

* :use-package quickrun
Quickrun can 'run' any (most) buffers - useful for developing bigger chunks of
code in a buffer, which quickrun turns into a kinda-repl
** :defer t
** :config
Don't timeout after 10 seconds if the program has not finished executing yet
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq quickrun-timeout-seconds 120)
#+end_src
** :bind
Use cmd-r to run it
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
("s-r" . quickrun)
#+end_src
* Setups for single modes
Require the mode-specific setup files that configure programming-modes:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require-all
   '(setup-c
     setup-go
     setup-lisp
     setup-markdown
     setup-haskell
     setup-web
     ))
#+end_src
* Provide it
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(provide 'setup-programming)
#+end_src
