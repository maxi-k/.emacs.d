#+TITLE: Setup which-key
#+DESCRIPTION: Describes all possible keys after a key-group key is pressed

* :use-package which-key
After entering a prefix key, which-key shows which keys can be pressed
afterwards and gives descriptions for them (most of the time).
** :defer t
** :config
The timer before =which-key= kicks in defaults to 1.0. Decrease that.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-idle-delay 0.5)
#+end_src

=C-h= does not work for paging because in this configuration it is set to
delete backwards. I have yet to figure out how to scroll through the pages now.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-paging-prefixes '("s-x"))
#+end_src
** :init
Activate it globally
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(which-key-mode)
#+end_src
* Provide it
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(provide 'setup-which-key)
#+end_src
