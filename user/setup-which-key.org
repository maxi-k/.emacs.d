#+TITLE: Setup which-key
#+DESCRIPTION: Describes all possible keys after a key-group key is pressed
#+AUTHOR: Maximilian Kuschewski
#+PROPERTY: my-file-type emacs-config-package
* Require it
* :use-package which-key
After entering a prefix key, which-key shows which keys can be pressed
afterwards and gives descriptions for them (most of the time).
** :defer t
** :config
The timer before =which-key= kicks in defaults to 1.0. Decrease that.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-idle-delay 0.5)
#+end_src

Note: =C-h= does not work for paging because in this configuration it is set to
delete backwards (See: [[setup-editing.org]]). I have to use backspace instead.

Activate it globally
