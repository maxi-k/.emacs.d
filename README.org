* Disclaimer
*This README is mostly a note for myself*, but someone else might find it useful.

There's probably some unnecessary stuff in here.

The custom file, packages, backup files, and persistent data are all excluded.

Both the gui- and terminal versions are working, though some keybindings won't be usable
in the terminal.

The settings are optimized for the standard US Mac keyboard.

* Org-mode config files?
I was inspired by [[https://github.com/howardabrams/dot-files][Howard Abrams]] excellent video [[http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html]["Literate DevOps"]] to convert my
configuration files to org-mode files where the actual setup code is embedded in
code-blocks, which is surrounded by explanation.

The commentary is still very sparse, which I will change over time.

When first starting emacs after cloning the repo, the elisp files
will be automatically generated from the org-files, and stored in ~user/elisp~.
They are then byte-compiled, and the original ~.el~ files deleted.

To do that again, run this provided command:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; C-u M-x emacs-config-compile RET
    (emacs-config-compile t)
#+end_src
If the first argument (= prefix argument) is non-nil, the whole ~elisp~ folder
will be deleted and recreated first.

** Writing configuration files
I use a slightly different approach to Howard Abrams - his can be found in his
dot-files available on github:

Emacs org configuration files must have the following property set:
#+begin_src org
#+PROPERTY: my-file-type emacs-config
#+end_src
This string is stored in the variable ~emacs-config-marker~

There is a org-mode safe-hook which checks for the presence of this property. If
it's there, the File will automatically be byte-compiled on save and stored in
the ~user/elisp~ directory. The org-file does not have to be in the ~.emacs.d~
directory for that to happen.

However, for the ~emacs-config-compile~ command to work (which is used to
compile all configuration files at once), the configuration file
has to be in ~.emacs.d/user~.

All of the code doing this can be found in ~user/user-init.el~, which is the
only emacs-lisp file in that directory.
